#  Qus 1: Write a program to reverse an array or string
### Given an array (or string), the task is to reverse the array/string.

#### Input  : arr[ ] = {1, 2, 3}

#### Output : arr [ ] = {3, 2, 1}

# Qus 2: Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons.

## Write a C function to return minimum and maximum in an array. You program should make minimum number of comparisons.

# Qus 3: Kth smallest element

## Given an array arr[] and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

#### Input:
First line of each testcase contains an integer N denoting size of the array. Second line contains N comma separated integer denoting elements of the array. Third line of the test case contains an integer K.

#### Output:
Corresponding to each test case, print the kth smallest element in a new line.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

#### Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105;
1 <= arr[i] <= 105;
1 <= K <= N

#### Example:

Input:
N=6; arr[ ]= 7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15; k=3

Output: 7

# Qus 4: Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s.

## Given an array A of size N containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; you need to sort the array in ascending order.

#### Input:
Each testcases contains two lines of input. The first line denotes the size of the array N. The second lines contains the elements of the array A separated by commas.

#### Output: 
For each testcase, print the sorted array.

#### Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106;
0 <= Ai <= 2

Example:

Input :
N=5; A = 0, 2, 1, 2, 0

Output:
0 0 1 2 2

# Qus 5: Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with constant extra space.

## An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.

#### Examples : 

#### Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6

#### Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5

# Qus 6: 

# Qus 7: Cyclically rotate an array by one 

## Given an array, cyclically rotate an array by one.

#### Input:
 Each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the array. The second lines contains the elements of the array A separated by commas.

#### Output:
Output the cyclically rotated array by one.

#### Constraints:
1<=N<=1000;
0<=A[i]<=1000

#### Example:
Input:

N=5; A = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Output:
5 1 2 3 4

# Qus 8: Kadane's Algorithm.
## Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.

#### Input:
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

#### Output:
Print the maximum sum of the contiguous sub-array in a separate line for each test case.

#### Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106;
-107 ≤ A[i] <= 107

#### Example:
Input: 
N=5; A = 1, 2, 3, -2, 5

Output: 9

# Qus 9: Minimize the heights.
## Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K, modify the heights of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by K only once. Find out the minimum difference of the heights of shortest and longest modified towers.

#### Input:
K = 2; N = 4

Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}

#### Output: 5

#### Explanation: The array can be modified as {3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
